The civilization flourished along the fertile banks of the Nile River, which provided the resources necessary for the development of a complex society. The predictable annual flooding of the Nile deposited nutrient-rich silt on the land, allowing for abundant agriculture that supported a growing population and specialized labor force.",

Some deities, like Ra (the sun god) and Osiris (god of the afterlife), were worshipped throughout Egypt, while others had more localized followings. The concept of ma'at—truth, balance, and order—was central to Egyptian religion and society. Egyptians believed in an afterlife and developed elaborate burial practices, including mummification, to prepare the deceased for their journey to the next world.",
