              Egypt. Our company registration number is EGT-12345, and we are licensed by the Egyptian Ministry of

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2.1 Booking Process</h3>
            <p>
              Bookings can be made through our website, by email, by telephone, or in person at our Cairo office. A
              booking is confirmed only after we have received the required deposit and sent you a written confirmation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Deposit and Final Payment</h3>
            <p>
              A non-refundable deposit of 25% of the total tour price is required to secure your booking. The remaining
              balance must be paid no later than 30 days before the tour start date. For bookings made within 30 days of
              the tour start date, full payment is required at the time of booking.

              We accept payment by credit/debit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, bank transfer, and
              cash (for in-person bookings at our Cairo office only). All prices are quoted in US Dollars (USD) unless
              otherwise specified.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2.4 Price Guarantee</h3>
